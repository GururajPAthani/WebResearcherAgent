This code sets up a simple AI agent using the **LangChain** framework. The agent's purpose is to use a large language model (LLM) running locally via **Ollama** to answer a user's question. If the LLM doesn't have the answer in its training data, it can use a web search tool to find it.

## Key Components

The code is built on several key components that work together to create the intelligent agent. 

### 1. Tools

The line `search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()` creates a tool that the agent can use. This tool is a wrapper around the **DuckDuckGo** search engine, allowing the agent to perform a web search to find up-to-date or specific information it doesn't already know.

### 2. The Language Model (LLM)

The line `llm = ChatOllama(model="llama2:latest", temperature=0)` initializes the core of the agent: a **language model**.
* **`ChatOllama`** is a LangChain class that acts as a bridge to your local **Ollama** server.
* **`model="llama2:latest"`** specifies which model to use. This model must be downloaded and running on your local machine via Ollama.
* **`temperature=0`** is a parameter that makes the model's output more deterministic and factual, which is generally good for tasks that require specific, factual answers.

### 3. The Prompt

The `custom_prompt_template` is the most important part of this setup. It's a structured set of instructions that tells the LLM exactly how to behave.
* It defines a **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** framework, which is a powerful technique for agents.
* It tells the LLM to think step-by-step (`Thought:`), choose a tool (`Action:`), and specify the input for that tool (`Action Input:`).
* Crucially, it also tells the LLM the exact format for the **final answer** (`Final Answer:`), which signals to the system that the task is complete. This is critical for preventing the agent from getting stuck in an endless loop.

## Putting It All Together

### Agent Creation

The line `agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, custom_prompt)` combines the three main components:
* The **LLM** (`llm`) provides the "brain."
* The **tools** (`tools`) give the agent capabilities beyond its built-in knowledge.
* The **prompt** (`custom_prompt`) provides the instructions for how the agent should use its brain and its tools.

### Execution

The `AgentExecutor` is what runs the entire process.
* `agent_executor = AgentExecutor(...)` creates the object that will manage the agent's workflow.
* `verbose=True` prints the agent's internal thoughts and actions, letting you see its reasoning process.
* **`handle_parsing_errors=True`** is a crucial parameter that helps prevent the agent from crashing. If the LLM generates an output that doesn't follow the required format, this setting sends the error back to the LLM as an observation, giving it a chance to correct its mistake and try again.

Finally, `agent_executor.invoke(...)` starts the agent's process with the user's query (`Explain calculs in brief?`). The agent will use its LLM and tools to try and answer the question, following the rules laid out in the prompt.
